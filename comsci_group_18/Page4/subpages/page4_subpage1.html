    <h1 id="Darragh">Hip Hop History: Pre 1990s</h1>
    <p id="Darragh">
      Hip hop sparks from the soul of the Bronx in the early 1970s, where young Black and Latino communities
	  transformed limited resources into limitless creativity. DJs like Kool Herc pioneered the “break”—isolating
	  the funkiest parts of a record—while MCs energized crowds with rhythmic chants that would later evolve into rap.
	  Block parties became the birthplace of a new cultural language, blending music, dance, and community in a way the
	  world had never seen.<br>
      </br>As the late ’70s and ’80s arrived, hip hop rapidly expanded in sound and ambition. Innovators like Grandmaster Flash
	  and Afrika Bambaataa shaped DJing into an art form, while acts like Run-D.M.C., LL Cool J, and Salt-N-Pepa pushed rap into
	  mainstream consciousness. Breakdancing crews turned cardboard into battlegrounds, and graffiti writers turned subway cars
	  into rolling galleries—proving hip hop wasn’t just a genre but a full-blown cultural movement.<br>
      </br>By the time the 1990s neared, hip hop had grown from local block parties to a national force. Its messages—raw, real, and
	  rebellious—resonated far beyond New York. Regional scenes bubbled up, artists experimented with new flows and sounds, and the
	  world began to recognize hip hop as a powerful medium for storytelling and social commentary. The foundation was set for the
	  genre’s explosive rise in the decades to follow.
