    <p id="Ben">
      Rock and Roll (Often shortened to Rock) has, since its mainstream breakthrough in the 1950's, consistently been one of the most popular genres of 
      popular music. A unique fusion of genres such as blues, jazz, and country just to name a few, the rebellious spirit of rock and roll music has captured 
      the minds of generations of people. From the sneering vocals of Mick Jagger, to the crashing drum fills of John Bonham, to the iconic slap of a Flea bass
      line, to David Gilmour's roaring guitar solos, this is a genre that has truly has something to offer for everyone.</p>
