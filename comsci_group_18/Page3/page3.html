    <h2 id="Sidney">Why Choose Metal?</h2>
    <p id="Sidney">
      Enjoy hearing instruments take the spotlight? Do you like when people pour their energy into their song and performance? <br>
      Well you've chosen the right genre, because metal is where the music takes your focus and transports you to a soundscape of
      heavy drum beats and guitar solos that usher waves of frisson, not to mention lyrics that range from melancholic to gutteral
      screaming. Whichever end of this spectrum you find yourself, we guarantee we'll have something that will scratch that itch!
